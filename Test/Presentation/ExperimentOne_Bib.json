  {"id":"abdellaouiLossAversionProspect2007","abstract":"Agrowing body of qualitative evidence shows that loss aversion, a phenomenon formalized in prospect theory, can explain a variety of field and experimental data. Quantifications of loss aversion are, however, hindered by the absence of a general preference-based method to elicit the utility for gains and losses simultaneously. This paper proposes such a method and uses it to measure loss aversion in an experimental study without making any parametric assumptions. Thus, it is the first to obtain a parameter-free elicitation of prospect theory's utility function on the whole domain. Our method also provides an efficient way to elicit utility midpoints, which are important in axiomatizations of utility. Several definitions of loss aversion have been put forward in the literature. According to most definitions we find strong evidence of loss aversion, at both the aggregate and the individual level. The degree of loss aversion varies with the definition used, which underlines the need for a commonly accepted definition of loss aversion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdellaoui","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Bleichrodt","given":"Han"},{"family":"Paraschiv","given":"Corina"}],"citation-key":"abdellaouiLossAversionProspect2007","container-title":"Management Science","container-title-short":"Management Science","DOI":"10.1287/mnsc.1070.0711","ISSN":"0025-1909, 1526-5501","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1659-1674","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Loss Aversion Under Prospect Theory: A Parameter-Free Measurement","title-short":"Loss Aversion Under Prospect Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0711","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"acarYouAreNot2016","abstract":"While researchers have developed many tools, techniques, and protocols for improving software security, exploits and breaches are only becoming more frequent. Some of this gap between theoretical security and actual vulnerability can be explained by insufficient consideration of human factors, broadly termed usability, when developing these mechanisms. In particular, security mechanisms may be difficult to use, may conflict with other priorities, or may assume more security knowledge than users possess. For almost 20 years, the usable security community has investigated how to improve the usability of security tools and interfaces aimed at end users. More recently, the community has begun to apply similar techniques in the context of improving security tools - such as APIs and bug-finding software - aimed not at end users but at developers, whose security errors are magnified across all users of their products. In this paper, we review key lessons learned from usable security for end users and consider how to apply them in the context of developers. We propose a research agenda aimed at developing a high-quality, comprehensive literature for usable security for developers, including: investigating how to conduct reliable research in this context, understanding developers' attitudes, knowledge, and priorities, measuring the status quo, and developing improved tools and interventions in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Acar","given":"Yasemin"},{"family":"Fahl","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Mazurek","given":"Michelle L."}],"citation-key":"acarYouAreNot2016","container-title":"IEEE Cybersecurity Development","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"page":"3-8","source":"main.sec.uni-hannover.de","title":"You are Not Your Developer, Either: A Research Agenda for Usable Security and Privacy Research Beyond End Users","title-short":"You are Not Your Developer, Either","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://main.sec.uni-hannover.de/publications/conf-secdev-acarfm16/"},

However, it is not clear what gamification brings to industrial software development settings. This paper intends to map the state of the art on the use and understanding of gamification in industrial software development. We aim to review the definitions of gamification adopted in software engineering studies, identify the elements of games that are used to motivate software engineers, and map the specific areas of software engineering that have been addressed so far. For that end, we conducted a mixed method literature review, covering 130 studies. From such review, we found that (1) researchers in the field tend towards a strict view of gamification, (2) the practical results of gamification are unclear and polemic, and (3) this research area has still much to improve.","author":[{"family":"Barreto","given":"Carlos Futino"},{"family":"França","given":"César"}],"citation-key":"barretoGamificationSoftwareEngineering2021","container-title":"2021 IEEE/ACM 13th International Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE)","DOI":"10.1109/CHASE52884.2021.00020","event-title":"2021 IEEE/ACM 13th International Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE)","ISSN":"2574-1837","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5]]},"page":"105-108","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Gamification in Software Engineering: A literature Review","title-short":"Gamification in Software Engineering","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"bialekCognitiveReflectionTest2018","abstract":"The cognitive reflection test (CRT) is a widely used measure of the propensity to engage in analytic or deliberative reasoning in lieu of gut feelings or intuitions. CRT problems are unique because they reliably cue intuitive but incorrect responses and, therefore, appear simple among those who do poorly. By virtue of being composed of so-called \"trick problems\" that, in theory, could be discovered as such, it is commonly held that the predictive validity of the CRT is undermined by prior experience with the task. Indeed, recent studies have shown that people who have had previous experience with the CRT score higher on the test. Naturally, however, it is not obvious that this actually undermines the predictive validity of the test. Across six studies with ~ 2,500 participants and 17 variables of interest (e.g., religious belief, bullshit receptivity, smartphone usage, susceptibility to heuristics and biases, and numeracy), we did not find a single case in which the predictive power of the CRT was significantly undermined by repeated exposure. This occurred despite the fact that we replicated the previously reported increase in accuracy among individuals who reported previous experience with the CRT. We speculate that the CRT remains robust after multiple exposures because less reflective (more intuitive) individuals fail to realize that being presented with apparently easy problems more than once confers information about the task's actual difficulty.","archive_location":"28849403","author":[{"family":"Białek","given":"Michał"},{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"}],"citation-key":"bialekCognitiveReflectionTest2018","container-title":"Behav Res Methods","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-017-0963-x","edition":"2017/08/30","ISSN":"1554-3528 (Electronic) 1554-351X (Linking)","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"page":"1953-1959","title":"The cognitive reflection test is robust to multiple exposures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849403","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"brunBlindspotsPythonJava2022","abstract":"Blindspots in APIs can cause software engineers to introduce vulnerabilities, but such blindspots are, unfortunately, common. We study the effect APIs with blindspots have on developers in two languages by replicating a 109-developer, 24-Java-API controlled experiment. Our replication applies to Python and involves 129 new developers and 22 new APIs. We find that using APIs with blindspots statistically significantly reduces the developers’ ability to correctly reason about the APIs in both languages, but that the effect is more pronounced for Python. Interestingly, for Java, the effect increased with complexity of the code relying on the API, whereas for Python, the opposite was true. This suggests that Python developers are less likely to notice potential for vulnerabilities in complex code than in simple code, whereas Java developers are more likely to recognize the extra complexity and apply more care, but are more careless with simple code. Whether the developers considered API uses to be more difficult, less clear, and less familiar did not have an effect on their ability to correctly reason about them. Developers with better long-term memory recall were more likely to correctly reason about APIs with blindspots, but short-term memory, processing speed, episodic memory, and memory span had no effect. Surprisingly, professional experience and expertise did not improve the developers’ ability to reason about APIs with blindspots across both languages, with long-term professionals with many years of experience making mistakes as often as relative novices. Finally, personality traits did not significantly affect the Python developers’ ability to reason about APIs with blindspots, but less extraverted and more open developers were better at reasoning about Java APIs with blindspots. Overall, our findings suggest that blindspots in APIs are a serious problem across languages, and that experience and education alone do not overcome that problem, suggesting that tools are needed to help developers recognize blindspots in APIs as they write code that uses those APIs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Brun","given":"Yuriy"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Somerville","given":"Jessie Elise"},{"family":"Myers","given":"Elisha M."},{"family":"Ebner","given":"Natalie C."}],"citation-key":"brunBlindspotsPythonJava2022","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"capposVulnerabilitiesBlindSpots2014","abstract":"The security community spares no effort in emphasizing security awareness and the importance of building secure software. However, the number of new vulnerabilities found in today’s systems is still increasing. Furthermore, old and well-studied vulnerability types such as buffer overﬂows and SQL injections, are still repeatedly reported in vulnerability databases. Historically, the common response has been to blame the developers for their lack of security education. This paper discusses a new hypothesis to explain this problem by introducing a new security paradigm where software vulnerabilities are viewed as developers’ blind spots in their decision making. We argue that such a ﬂawed mental process is heuristic-based, where humans solve problems without considering all the information available, just like taking shortcuts. This paper’s thesis is that security thinking tends to be left out by developers during their programming, as vulnerabilities usually exist in corner cases with unusual information ﬂows. Leveraging this paradigm, this paper introduces a novel methodology for capturing and understanding security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, it discusses how this methodology can be applied to the design and implementation of the next generation of automated diagnosis tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cappos","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Zhuang","given":"Yanyan"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Daniela Seabra"},{"family":"Rosenthal","given":"Marissa"},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Kuo-Chuan"}],"citation-key":"capposVulnerabilitiesBlindSpots2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2014 workshop on New Security Paradigms Workshop - NSPW '14","DOI":"10.1145/2683467.2683472","event-place":"Victoria, British Columbia, Canada","event-title":"the 2014 workshop","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3062-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"53-62","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Victoria, British Columbia, Canada","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vulnerabilities as Blind Spots in Developer's Heuristic-Based Decision-Making Processes","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2683467.2683472"},

Although soft skills are among the most important aspects in the creation of software, they are often overlooked by educators and practitioners. One of the main reasons for the oversight is that soft skills are usually related to social and personality factors, i.e., teamwork, motivation, commitment, leadership, multi-culturalism, emotions, interpersonal skills, etc. This editorial is a manifesto declaring the importance of soft skills in software engineering with the intention to draw professionals attention to these topics. We have approached this issue by mentioning what we know about the field, what we believe to be evident, and which topics need further investigation. Important references to back up our claims are also included. Software engineers take pride in the depth of their technical expertise, which separates them from the crowd. But, what makes a good software engineer? First, it is the technical knowledge of relevant methodologies and techniques (i.e. hard skills), as well as the skills necessary for applying that knowledge in practice. Second, but nonetheless important, it is a set of soft skills, in particular collaboration, communication, problem-solving and similar interpersonal and critical thinking skills that are expected from software engineering professionals. In other words, software engineers need both hard and soft skills in order to be successful at the workplace.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Capretz","given":"Luiz Fernando"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Faheem"}],"citation-key":"capretzCallPromoteSoft2018","container-title":"Psychology and Cognitive Sciences - Open Journal","container-title-short":"Psychol Cogn Sci Open J","DOI":"10.17140/PCSOJ-4-e011","ISSN":"2380727X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,2]]},"page":"e1-e3","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Call to Promote Soft Skills in Software Engineering","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01819","volume":"4"},

Since developers often tend to focus on functionality ﬁrst and security later, similar to end users, we prompted half the participants for security. Although the freelancers indicated that they feel responsible for security, our results showed that they did not focus on security in their code reviews, even in a securitycritical task such as password-storage. Almost half the participants wanted to release the insecure code snippets. However, we found that security prompting had a signiﬁcant effect on the security awareness.

  {"id":"deneysBatsBallsSubstitution2013","abstract":"Influential work on human thinking suggests that our judgment is often biased because we minimize cognitive effort and intuitively substitute hard questions by easier ones. A key question is whether or not people realize that they are doing this and notice their mistake. Here, we test this claim with one of the most publicized examples of the substitution bias, the bat-and-ball problem. We designed an isomorphic control version in which reasoners experience no intuitive pull to substitute. Results show that people are less confident in their substituted, erroneous bat-and-ball answer than in their answer on the control version that does not give rise to the substitution. Contrary to popular belief, this basic finding indicates that biased reasoners are not completely oblivious to the substitution and sense that their answer is questionable.

However, they have been attacked as a category, incorrectly assuming there is a generic version that applies to all. We identify and respond to 5 main lines of argument made by such critics. We agree that some of these arguments have force against some of the theories in the literature but believe them to be overstated. We argue that the dual-processing distinction is supported by much recent evidence in cognitive science. Our preferred theoretical approach is one in which rapid autonomous processes (Type 1) are assumed to yield default responses unless intervened on by distinctive higher order reasoning processes (Type 2). What defines the difference is that Type 2 processing supports hypothetical thinking and load heavily on working memory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Jonathan St. B.

A distinction is drawn between heuristic processes which select items of task information as ‘relevant’, and analytic processes which operate on the selected items to generate inferences or judgements. These two stages are illustrated in a selective review of work on both deductive and statistical reasoning. Factors identified as contributing to heuristic selection include perceptual salience, linguistic suppositions and semantic associations. Analytic processes are considered to be context dependent: people reason from experience, not from inference rules.

  {"id":"evansIntuitionReasoningDualProcess2010","abstract":"A lay definition of intuition holds that it involves immediate apprehension in the absence of reasoning. From a more technical point of view, I argue also that intuition should be seen as the contrastive of reasoning, corresponding roughly to the distinction between Type 1 (intuitive) and Type 2 (reflective) processes in contemporary dual process theories of thinking. From this perspective, we already know a great deal about intuition: It is quick, provides feelings of confidence, can reflect large amounts of information processing, and is most likely to provide accurate judgments when based on relevant experiential learning. Unlike reasoning, intuition is low effort and does not compete for central working memory resources. It provides default responses which may—or often may not—be intervened upon with high effort, reflective reasoning. Intuition has, however, been blamed for a range of cognitive biases in the psychological literatures on reasoning and decision making. The evidence indicates that with novel and abstract problems, not easily linked to previous experience, intervention with effortful reasoning is often required to avoid such biases. Hence, although it seems that intuition dominates reasoning most of the time—both in the laboratory and the real world—it can indeed be a false friend.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Jonathan St. B.

  {"id":"evansThinkingTwiceTwo2010","abstract":"Common sense suggests that we are in complete control of the actions we perform—that all our actions are the result of considered and conscious preparation. Yet, there are countless examples of this control breaking down, for example, in the case of phobias and compulsive actions. We can all recall those times when, in the 'heat of the moment', our actions have been very different to those that would have resulted from calm and considered reflection. In extreme moments of 'absent-mindedness' our actions can even have catastrophic consequences, resulting in harm to ourselves and others. So why does this happen—why do apparently rational and intelligent beings make, what appear to be, such fundamental errors in their thinking? Thinking Twice explores the idea that humans have two distinct minds within their brains: one intuitive and the other reflective. The intuitive mind is old, evolved early, and shares many of its features with animal cognition. It is the source of emotion and intuitions, and reflects both the habits acquired in our lifetime and the adaptive behaviours evolved by ancient ancestors. The reflective mind, by contrast, is recently evolved and distinctively human: It enables us to think in abstract and hypothetical ways about the world around us and to calculate the future consequences of our actions. The evolution of the new, reflective mind is linked with the development of language and the very large forebrains that distinguish humans from other species; It has also given us our unique human form of intelligence. On occasions though, our two minds can come into conflict, and when this happens, the old mind often wins. These conflicts are rationalized so that we, conscious persons, are unaware that the intuitive mind is in control. Written by a leading cognitive scientist, this book demonstrates how much of our behaviour is controlled by automatic and intuitive mental processes, which shape as well as compete with our conscious thinking and decision-making. Accessibly written, and assuming no prior knowledge of the field, it is fascinating reading for all those interested in human behaviour, including students and researchers in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

In the literature survey, we systematically collected and analysed 311 scientific papers spanning five decades and classified them using the cognitive concepts from the taxonomy. Our analysis shows that the most developed areas of research correspond to the four life-cycle stages, software requirements, design, construction, and maintenance. Most research is quantitative and focuses on knowledge, cognitive load, memory, and reasoning. Overall, the state of the art appears fragmented when viewed from the perspective of cognition.

  {"id":"gigerenzerHeuristicDecisionMaking2011","abstract":"As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do “rational” decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (“Which heuristics do people use in which situations?”) and the prescriptive question (“When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?”), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gigerenzer","given":"Gerd"},{"family":"Gaissmaier","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"gigerenzerHeuristicDecisionMaking2011","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"451-482","PMID":"21126183","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Heuristic Decision Making","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346","volume":"62"},

This view provides an important correction on embodied accounts of language that reduce language to action, perception, emotion and mental simulation. The presence of a language system has, however, also important consequences for perception, action, emotion, and memory. Language stamps signals from perception, action, and emotional systems with rich cognitive markers that transform the role of these signals in the overall cognitive architecture of the human mind. This view does not deny that language is implemented by means of universal principles of neural organization. However, language creates the possibility to generate rich internal models of the world that are shaped and made accessible by the characteristics of a language system. This makes us less dependent on direct action-perception couplings and might even sometimes go at the expense of the veridicality of perception. In cognitive (neuro)science the pendulum has swung from language as the key to understand the organization of the human mind to the perspective that it is a byproduct of perception and action.

They have been examined across a wide range of fields, including economics, psychology, and computer science. However, scholars still struggle to find substantial common ground. This study provides a historical review of heuristics as a research topic before and after the emergence of the subjective expected utility (SEU) theory, emphasising the evolutionary perspective that considers heuristics as resulting from the development of the brain. We find it useful to distinguish between deliberate and automatic uses of heuristics, but point out that they can be used consciously and subconsciously. While we can trace the idea of heuristics through many centuries and fields of application, we focus on the evolution of the modern notion of heuristics through three waves of research, starting with Herbert Simon in the 1950s, who introduced the notion of bounded rationality and suggested the use of heuristics in artificial intelligence, thereby paving the way for all later research on heuristics. A breakthrough came with Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s, who analysed the biases arising from using heuristics. The resulting research programme became the subject of criticism by Gerd Gigerenzer in the 1990s, who argues that an ‘adaptive toolbox’ consisting of ‘fast-and-frugal’ heuristics can yield ‘ecologically rational’ decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hjeij","given":"Mohamad"},{"family":"Vilks","given":"Arnis"}],"citation-key":"hjeijBriefHistoryHeuristics2023","container-title":"Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","container-title-short":"Humanit Soc Sci Commun","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-023-01542-z","ISSN":"2662-9992","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,17]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-15","publisher":"Palgrave","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A brief history of heuristics: how did research on heuristics evolve?","title-short":"A brief history of heuristics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01542-z","volume":"10"},

We find that investor perceptions and changes therein are important drivers of actual trading and risk-taking behavior: Investors with higher levels of and upward revisions of return expectations are more likely to trade, have higher turnover, trade larger amounts per transaction, and use derivatives. Investors with higher levels of and upward revisions in risk tolerance are more likely to trade, have higher buy-sell ratios, use limit orders more frequently, and hold riskier portfolios.

  {"id":"hooverBatandballProblemStronger2019","abstract":"Traditional accounts of reasoning have characterized human error response to be an unconscious process whereby cognitive misers blindly neglect the critical information that would lead to problem solution, thereby substituting an easier problem for the actual problem (e.g., Kahneman & Frederick, 2002). For the bat-and-ball problem, the unconscious substitution hypothesis is challenged on 2 fronts in the present study: (a) testing for conscious representation of the error-inducing semantic content of the problem (i.e., the “more than” phrase, “The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.”); and (b) comparing experimentally response confidence differences between standard versions of the problem and isomorphic controls (without that phrase) to verify postdecision sensitivity to the errors, following De Neys, Rossi, and Houdé (2013). Crucially, even when interference questions were included between testing and memory response, incorrect reasoners largely had accurate recall and recognition of the problem’s error-inducing phrase. Incorrect reasoners’ intraindividual error sensitivity was replicated and extended via the introduction of a social-metacognitive measurement, which was found to be correlated with intraindividual postdecision confidence and also yielded an error sensitivity effect. Finally, latency responses verify the relationship between time spent reasoning and postdecision confidence. Implications and future directions are discussed.

  {"id":"ivoryCanYouHear2023","abstract":"How do software developers view issues of secure software development? Drawing upon psychological theories of social identity and cognitive processing, we engage with software engineers about security in their software to illustrate how self-defined social identities affect approaches to development. We also identify behaviours indicative of increased risk of project delays or failure. Professional freelance software developers together with computer science students addressed perceptions of risk and security during development. A thematic analysis extracted three core themes of Responsibility, Optimism and Risk (ROAR). We show how language about responsibility for security is framed through concepts of diffusion, displacement, and acceptance of responsibility. We also examine the way developers orientate to risk awareness, appetites for risk, and risk mitigation strategies. Examples of unrealistic optimism biases are highlighted and discussed. We discuss our findings in relation to psychological theories of responsibility, decision making and heuristics and biases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ivory","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Sturdee","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Towse","given":"John Nicholas"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Nuseibeh","given":"Bashar"}],"citation-key":"ivoryCanYouHear2023","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/pexvz","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,20]]},"language":"en-us","publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"Can you hear the ROAR of software security?

  {"id":"ivorySoftSkillsSoftware2022","abstract":"When writing software code, developers typically prioritise functionality over security, either consciously or unconsciously through biases and heuristics. This is often attributed to tangible pressures such as client requirements, but little is understood about the psychological dimensions affecting security behaviours. There is an increasing demand for understanding how psychological skills affect secure software development and to understand how these skills themselves are developed during the learning process. This doctoral research explores this research space, with aims to identify important workplace-based skills for software developers; to identify and empirically investigate the soft skills behind these workplace skills in order to understand how soft skills can influence security behaviours; and, to identify ways to introduce and teach soft skills to computer science students to prepare the future generation of software developers. The motivations behind this research are presented alongside the work plan. Three distinct phases are introduced, along with planned analyses. Phase one is currently in the data collection stage, with the second phase in planning. Prior relevant work is highlighted, and the paper concludes with a presentation of preliminary results and the planned next steps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ivory","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"ivorySoftSkillsSoftware2022","collection-title":"EASE '22","container-title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering 2022","DOI":"10.1145/3530019.3535344","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9613-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,13]]},"page":"317–322","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Soft Skills of Software Learning Development: the Psychological Dimensions of Computing and Security Behaviours","title-short":"The Soft Skills of Software Learning Development","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3530019.3535344"},

It will be of interest to a broad spectrum of cognitive scientists, including linguists, philosophers, psycholinguists, neuroscientists, cognitive anthropologists, and evolutionary psychologists.Jackendoff argues that linguistics has become isolated from the other cognitive sciences at least partly because of the syntax-based architecture assumed by mainstream generative grammar. He proposes an alternative parallel architecture for the language faculty that permits a greater internal integration of the components of language and connects far more naturally to such larger issues in cognitive neuroscience as language processing, the connection of language to vision, and the evolution of language.Extending this approach beyond the language capacity, Jackendoff proposes sharper criteria for a satisfactory theory of consciousness, examines the structure of complex everyday actions, and investigates the concepts involved in an individual's grasp of society and culture. Each of these domains is used to reflect back on the question of what is unique about human language and what follows from more general properties of the mind.Language, Consciousness, Culture extends Jackendoff's pioneering theory of conceptual semantics to two of the most important domains of human thought: social cognition and theory of mind. Jackendoff's formal framework allows him to draw new connections among a large variety of literatures and to uncover new distinctions and generalizations not previously recognized. The breadth of the approach will foster cross-disciplinary conversation; the vision is to develop a richer understanding of human nature.","author":[{"family":"Jackendoff","given":"Ray S."}],"citation-key":"jackendoffLanguageConsciousnessCulture2009","ISBN":"978-0-262-30364-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"431","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Language, Consciousness, Culture: Essays on Mental Structure","title-short":"Language, Consciousness, Culture","type":"book"},

Yet user response to phishing emails is far from uniform; some respond while others do not. What is the source of this diversity in decision-making? From a psychological perspective, we consider cognitive and situational influences that might explain why certain users are more susceptible than others. Alongside an email judgment task employed as a proxy for fraud susceptibility, 224 participants completed a range of cognitive tasks. In addition, we manipulated time pressure for email legitimacy judgments. We identify cognitive reflection and sensation seeking as significant, albeit modest, predictors of susceptibility. Further to this, participants asked to make quicker responses made more judgment errors. We conclude there are cognitive signatures that partially contribute to email fraud susceptibility, with implications for efforts to limit online security breaches and train secure behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Helen S."},{"family":"Towse","given":"John"},{"family":"Race","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"jonesEmailFraudSearch2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0209684","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e0209684","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Email fraud: The search for psychological predictors of susceptibility","title-short":"Email fraud","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209684","volume":"14"},

Starting from the obvious fact that professional intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes flawed, the authors attempt to map the boundary conditions that separate true intuitive skill from overconfident and biased impressions. They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual’s opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment.

  {"id":"kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979","abstract":"This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahneman","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tversky","given":"Amos"}],"citation-key":"kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979","container-title":"Econometrica","DOI":"10.2307/1914185","ISSN":"0012-9682","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1979]]},"page":"263-291","publisher":"[Wiley, Econometric Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk","title-short":"Prospect Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185","volume":"47"},

However, not all proposed tools and methodologies are widely used in software development. We assume that the evaluation of tools and methodologies by developers is different from the evaluation by researchers, and that this is one of the reasons why the tools and methodologies are not widely used. We analyzed the decision criteria of software developers as applied to the tools and methodologies, to clarify whether the difference exists or not. In behavioral economics, there are theories which assume people have biases, and they do not always act reasonably. In the experiment, we made a questionnaire based on behavioral economics, and collected answers from open source software developers. The results suggest that developers do not always act to maximize expected profit because of the certainty effect and ambiguity aversion. Therefore, we should reconsider the evaluation criteria of tools such as the f-measure or AUC, which mainly focus on the expected profit.","author":[{"family":"Kina","given":"Kanako"},{"family":"Tsunoda","given":"Masateru"},{"family":"Hata","given":"Hideaki"},{"family":"Tamada","given":"Haruaki"},{"family":"Igaki","given":"Hiroshi"}],"citation-key":"kinaAnalyzingDecisionCriteria2016","container-title":"2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER)","DOI":"10.1109/SANER.2016.115","event-title":"2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3]]},"page":"644-648","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Analyzing the Decision Criteria of Software Developers Based on Prospect Theory","type":"paper-conference","volume":"1"},

But when it comes to managing employee’s information security behaviour, many organisations still use policies proscribing behaviour and sanctioning non-compliance. Whilst many organisations are aware that this “comply or die” approach does not work for modern enterprises where employees collaborate, share, and show initiative, they do not have an alternative approach to fostering secure behaviour. We present an interview analysis of 126 employees’ reasons for not complying with organisational policies, identifying the perceived conflict of security with productive activities as the key driver for non-compliance and confirm the results using a survey of 1256 employees. We conclude that effective problem detection and security measure adaptation needs to be de-centralised - employees are the principal agents who must decide how to implement security in specific contexts. But this requires a higher level of security awareness and skills than most employees currently have. Any campaign aimed at security behaviour needs to transform employee’s perception of their role in security, transforming them to security-aware principal agents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirlappos","given":"Iacovos"},{"family":"Beautement","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Sasse","given":"M.

  {"id":"liberaliIndividualDifferencesNumeracy2012","abstract":"Despite evidence that individual differences in numeracy affect judgment and decision making, the precise mechanisms underlying how such differences produce biases and fallacies remain unclear. Numeracy scales have been developed without sufficient theoretical grounding, and their relation to other cognitive tasks that assess numerical reasoning, such as the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), has been debated. In studies conducted in Brazil and in the USA, we administered an objective Numeracy Scale (NS), Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS), and the CRT to assess whether they measured similar constructs. The Rational–Experiential Inventory, inhibition (go/no-go task), and intelligence were also investigated. By examining factor solutions along with frequent errors for questions that loaded on each factor, we characterized different types of processing captured by different items on these scales. We also tested the predictive power of these factors to account for biases and fallacies in probability judgments. In the first study, 259 Brazilian undergraduates were tested on the conjunction and disjunction fallacies. In the second study, 190 American undergraduates responded to a ratio-bias task. Across the different samples, the results were remarkably similar. The results indicated that the CRT is not just another numeracy scale, that objective and subjective numeracy scales do not measure an identical construct, and that different aspects of numeracy predict different biases and fallacies. Dimensions of numeracy included computational skills such as multiplying, proportional reasoning, mindless or verbatim matching, metacognitive monitoring, and understanding the gist of relative magnitude, consistent with dual-process theories such as fuzzy-trace theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Liberali","given":"Jordana M"},{"family":"Reyna","given":"Valerie F"},{"family":"Furlan","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Lilian M"},{"family":"Pardo","given":"Seth T"}],"citation-key":"liberaliIndividualDifferencesNumeracy2012","container-title":"Journal of behavioral decision making","container-title-short":"J Behav Decis Mak","DOI":"10.1002/bdm.752","ISSN":"0894-3257","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10]]},"page":"361-381","PMCID":"PMC3716015","PMID":"23878413","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Individual Differences in Numeracy and Cognitive Reflection, with Implications for Biases and Fallacies in Probability Judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716015/","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"manzoorIntrinsicRewardsEmployee2021","abstract":"The prime goal of this study is to analyze the impact of intrinsic rewards on the performance of an employee. It also focuses on the role of motivation of the employee as an intervening factor. To achieve this objective, data have been collected through the questionnaire method from small and medium enterprises of Pakistan. A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed to the target population, and 300 were received. To test the hypotheses, the confirmatory factor analysis and the structural equation modeling have been used. The main results of the study have shown a positive and significant impact of intrinsic rewards on the performance of the employee. Specifically, the study reveals that the motivation of an employee significantly mediates the association between intrinsic rewards and the performance of the employee. In the light of the findings, implications are outlined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Manzoor","given":"Faiza"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Longbao"},{"family":"Asif","given":"Muhammad"}],"citation-key":"manzoorIntrinsicRewardsEmployee2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Intrinsic Rewards and Employee's Performance With the Mediating Mechanism of Employee's Motivation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.563070","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"mohananiCognitiveBiasesSoftware2020","abstract":"One source of software project challenges and failures is the systematic errors introduced by human cognitive biases. Although extensively explored in cognitive psychology, investigations concerning cognitive biases have only recently gained popularity in software engineering research. This paper therefore systematically maps, aggregates and synthesizes the literature on cognitive biases in software engineering to generate a comprehensive body of knowledge, understand state-of-the-art research and provide guidelines for future research and practise. Focusing on bias antecedents, effects and mitigation techniques, we identified 65 articles (published between 1990 and 2016), which investigate 37 cognitive biases. Despite strong and increasing interest, the results reveal a scarcity of research on mitigation techniques and poor theoretical foundations in understanding and interpreting cognitive biases. Although bias-related research has generated many new insights in the software engineering community, specific bias mitigation techniques are still needed for software professionals to overcome the deleterious effects of cognitive biases on their work.","author":[{"family":"Mohanani","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Salman","given":"Iflaah"},{"family":"Turhan","given":"Burak"},{"family":"Rodríguez","given":"Pilar"},{"family":"Ralph","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"mohananiCognitiveBiasesSoftware2020","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TSE.2018.2877759","ISSN":"1939-3520","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"page":"1318-1339","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study","title-short":"Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"molokkenExpertEstimationWebDevelopment2005","abstract":"Estimating the effort required to complete web-development projects involves input from people in both technical (e.g., programming), and non-technical (e.g., user interaction design) roles. This paper examines how the employees' role and type of competence may affect their estimation strategy and performance. An analysis of actual web-development project data and results from an experiment suggest that people with technical competence provided less realistic project effort estimates than those with less technical competence. This means that more knowledge about how to implement a requirement specification does not always lead to better estimation performance. We discuss, amongst others, two possible reasons for this observation: (1) Technical competence induces a bottom-up, construction-based estimation strategy, while lack of this competence induces a more “outside” view of the project, using a top-down estimation strategy. An “outside” view may encourage greater use of the history of previous projects and reduce the bias towards over-optimism. (2) Software professionals in technical roles perceive that they are evaluated as more skilled when providing low effort estimates. A consequence of our findings is that the choice of estimation strategy, estimation evaluation criteria and feedback are important aspects to consider when seeking to improve estimation accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mølokken","given":"Kjetil"},{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Magne"}],"citation-key":"molokkenExpertEstimationWebDevelopment2005","container-title":"Empirical Software Engineering","container-title-short":"Empirical Software Engineering","DOI":"10.1023/B:EMSE.0000048321.46871.2e","ISSN":"1573-7616","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"7-30","source":"Springer Link","title":"Expert Estimation of Web-Development Projects: Are Software Professionals in Technical Roles More Optimistic Than Those in Non-Technical Roles?","title-short":"Expert Estimation of Web-Development Projects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/B:EMSE.0000048321.46871.2e","volume":"10"},

While cryptography algorithms have become increasingly advanced, many data breaches occur because developers do not correctly use the corresponding APIs. To guide future research into practical solutions to this problem, we perform an empirical investigation into the obstacles developers face while using the Java cryptography APIs, the tasks they use the APIs for, and the kind of (tool) support they desire. We triangulate data from four separate studies that include the analysis of 100 StackOverflow posts, 100 GitHub repositories, and survey input from 48 developers. We find that while developers find it difficult to use certain cryptographic algorithms correctly, they feel surprisingly confident in selecting the right cryptography concepts (e.g., encryption vs. signatures). We also find that the APIs are generally perceived to be too low-level and that developers prefer more task-based solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Nadi","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Krüger","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Mezini","given":"Mira"},{"family":"Bodden","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"nadiJumpingHoopsWhy2016","collection-title":"ICSE '16","container-title":"Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","DOI":"10.1145/2884781.2884790","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3900-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,14]]},"page":"935–946","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Jumping through hoops: why do Java developers struggle with cryptography APIs?","title-short":"Jumping through hoops","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884790"},

The authors' results showed that, without explicit prompting, none of the students implemented secure password storage. When asked about this oversight, a common answer was that they would have implemented secure storage - if they were creating code for a company. To shed light on this possible confusion, we conducted a mixed-methods field study with developers. We hired freelance developers online and gave them a similar password storage task followed by a questionnaire to gain additional insights into their work. From our research, we offer two contributions. First of all, we reveal that, similar to the students, freelancers do not store passwords securely unless prompted, they have misconceptions about secure password storage, and they use outdated methods.

The study employed an in-depth phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of 11 victims of hacking. Semi-structured interviews were used as a tool for data collection, and thematic analysis of the data revealed four main themes: emotional impact; an increased sense of vulnerability; a sense of violation; and coping strategies. The findings highlight that hacking may have significant consequences for victims, and further, that hacking may represent an intrusion into a victim?s ?digital space.?

In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they were asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, greater cognitive reflection and science knowledge were associated with stronger discernment. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study (i.e., judging the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline) nearly tripled the level of truth discernment in participants’ subsequent sharing intentions. Our results, which mirror those found previously for political fake news, suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"McPhetres","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yunhao"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jackson G."},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"pennycookFightingCOVID19Misinformation2020","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797620939054","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"770-780","PMCID":"PMC7366427","PMID":"32603243","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Fighting COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media: Experimental Evidence for a Scalable Accuracy-Nudge Intervention","title-short":"Fighting COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620939054","volume":"31"},

One way to address this is to focus on common systematic errors made by software project participants. In many cases, such errors are manifestations of cognitive biases. Consequently this paper proposes a theory of the role of cognitive biases in software development project success. The proposed theory posits that such errors are mutual properties of people and tasks; they may therefore be avoided by modifying the person-task system using specific sociotechnical interventions. The theory is illustrated using the case of planning poker, a task estimation technique designed to overcome anchoring bias.","author":[{"family":"Ralph","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"ralphTheoryDebiasingSoftware2011","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","container-title":"Research in Systems Analysis and Design: Models and Methods","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-25676-9_8","editor":[{"family":"Wrycza","given":"Stanisław"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-642-25676-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","page":"92-105","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"Toward a Theory of Debiasing Software Development","type":"paper-conference"},

It is important to understand why technological advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests “adaptive security interventions” as a solution that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Rauf","given":"Irum"},{"family":"Petre","given":"Marian"},{"family":"Tun","given":"Thein"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Lunn","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Van Der Linden","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Towse","given":"John"},{"family":"Sharp","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Awais"},{"family":"Nuseibeh","given":"Bashar"}],"citation-key":"raufCaseAdaptiveSecurity2021","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"rheeUnrealisticOptimismInformation2012","abstract":"Information security is a critical issue that many firms face these days. While increasing incidents of information security breaches have generated extensive publicity, previous studies repeatedly expose low levels of managerial awareness and commitment, a key obstacle to achieving a good information security posture. The main motivation of our study emanates from this phenomenon that the increased vulnerability to information security breaches is coupled with the low level of managerial awareness and commitment regarding information security threats. We report this dissonance by addressing a cognitive bias called optimistic bias. Using a survey, we study if MIS executives are subject to such a bias in their vulnerability perceptions of information security. We find that they demonstrate optimistic bias in risk perception on information security domain. The extent of this optimistic bias is greater with a distant comparison target with fewer information sharing activities. This optimistic bias is also found to be related to perception of controllability with information security threats. In order to overcome the effects of optimistic bias, firms need more security awareness training and systematic treatments of security threats instead of relying on ad hoc approach to security measure implementation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Rhee","given":"Hyeun-Suk"},{"family":"Ryu","given":"Young U."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Cheong-Tag"}],"citation-key":"rheeUnrealisticOptimismInformation2012","container-title":"Computers & Security","container-title-short":"Computers & Security","DOI":"10.1016/j.cose.2011.12.001","ISSN":"0167-4048","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"221-232","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Unrealistic optimism on information security management","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404811001441","volume":"31"},

All of the essays are concerned, in one way or another, with the ways in which findings and theories in the cognitive sciences can contribute to, and sometimes reshape traditional philosophical conversations and debates. A central theme in the essays on epistemology and rationality is the philosophical significance of empirical work on human reasoning done by researchers in the \"heuristics and biases\" tradition, and by their critics in evolutionary psychology. In the essays on morality, a wide range of empirical work is explored, including studies of the psychological foundations of norms, work on the moral / conventional distinction, and empirical attempts to determine whether humans ever act on altruistic motives. Stich was one of the pioneers in the experimental philosophy movement, and work in experimental philosophy plays a prominent role in many of these essays.

  {"id":"schielzethRobustnessLinearMixedeffects2020","abstract":"Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Schielzeth","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Dingemanse","given":"Niels J."},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Westneat","given":"David F."},{"family":"Allegue","given":"Hassen"},{"family":"Teplitsky","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Réale","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Dochtermann","given":"Ned A."},{"family":"Garamszegi","given":"László Zsolt"},{"family":"Araya-Ajoy","given":"Yimen G."}],"citation-key":"schielzethRobustnessLinearMixedeffects2020","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13434","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"1141-1152","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Robustness of linear mixed-effects models to violations of distributional assumptions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13434","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"sharotOptimismBias2011","abstract":"The ability to anticipate is a hallmark of cognition. Inferences about what will occur in the future are critical to decision making, enabling us to prepare our actions so as to avoid harm and gain reward. Given the importance of these future projections, one might expect the brain to possess accurate, unbiased foresight. Humans, however, exhibit a pervasive and surprising bias: when it comes to predicting what will happen to us tomorrow, next week, or fifty years from now, we overestimate the likelihood of positive events, and underestimate the likelihood of negative events. For example, we underrate our chances of getting divorced, being in a car accident, or suffering from cancer. We also expect to live longer than objective measures would warrant, overestimate our success in the job market, and believe that our children will be especially talented. This phenomenon is known as the optimism bias, and it is one of the most consistent, prevalent, and robust biases documented in psychology and behavioral economics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharot","given":"Tali"}],"citation-key":"sharotOptimismBias2011","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.030","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12,6]]},"language":"en","page":"R941-R945","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The optimism bias","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011912","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"shreeveMakingSenseUnknown2022","abstract":"Managers rarely have deep knowledge of cyber security, and yet are expected to make decisions with cyber security implications for software-based systems. We investigate the decision-making conversations of 7 teams of senior managers from the same organisation, as they complete the Decisions&Disruptions (D-D) cyber security exercise. We use Grounded Theory to situate our analysis of their decision-making and help us explore how these complex socio-cognitive interactions occur. We have developed a goal-model (using iStar 2.0) of the teams’ dialogue which illustrates what cyber security goals teams identify and how they operationalise their decisions to reach these goals. We complement this with our model of cyber security reasoning which describes how these teams make their decisions, showing how each team members’ experience, intuition and understanding affects the team’s overall shared reasoning and decision-making. Our findings show how managers with little cyber security expertise are able to use logic and traditional risk management thinking to make cyber security decisions. Despite their lack of cyber security specific training they demonstrate reasoning which closely resembles the decision-making approaches espoused in cyber security specific standards (e.g., NIST/ISO). Our work demonstrates how organisations and practitioners can enrich goal modelling to capture not only what security goals an organisation has (and how they can operationalise them) but also how and why these goals have been identified. Ultimately, non-cyber security experts can develop their cyber security model based on their current context (and update it when new requirements appear or new incidents happen), whilst capturing their reasoning at every stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Shreeve","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Gralha","given":"Catarina"},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Awais"},{"family":"Araujo","given":"João"},{"family":"Goulão","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"shreeveMakingSenseUnknown2022","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"siegristPerceptionRiskInfluence2005","abstract":"The influence of trust and confidence as personality traits on the perception of various hazards was examined. The distinction between trust and confidence is a key element of certain theories of co‐operation, but this dual‐mode approach has had little impact on empirical studies. General trust is the belief that other people can be relied on. General confidence is the conviction that everything is under control, and uncertainty is low. It was hypothesized that general trust and general confidence negatively influence risk perception. The hypothesis was tested using data from a random sample of 388 persons living in Switzerland. High levels of trust and confidence reduced perceived risks, compared with low levels of trust and confidence. Age was positively correlated with perceived risk. Gender was a significant predictor for technological hazards, but not for non‐technological hazards. Females perceived more risks than males. Results provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that general trust and general confidence have an impact on the perception of new technologies. Practical implications of the results are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Siegrist","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gutscher","given":"Heinz"},{"family":"Earle","given":"Timothy C."}],"citation-key":"siegristPerceptionRiskInfluence2005","container-title":"Journal of Risk Research","DOI":"10.1080/1366987032000105315","ISSN":"1366-9877","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,3,1]]},"page":"145-156","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Perception of risk: the influence of general trust, and general confidence","title-short":"Perception of risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1366987032000105315","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"sinayevCognitiveReflectionVs2015","abstract":"Scores on the three-item Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) have been linked with dual-system theory and normative decision making (Frederick, 2005). In particular, the CRT is thought to measure monitoring of System 1 intuitions such that, if cognitive reflection is high enough, intuitive errors will be detected and the problem will be solved. However, CRT items also require numeric ability to be answered correctly and it is unclear how much numeric ability vs. cognitive reflection contributes to better decision making. In two studies, CRT responses were used to calculate Cognitive Reflection and numeric ability; a numeracy scale was also administered. Numeric ability, measured on the CRT or the numeracy scale, accounted for the CRT’s ability to predict more normative decisions (a subscale of decision-making competence, incentivized measures of impatient and risk-averse choice, and self-reported financial outcomes); Cognitive Reflection contributed no independent predictive power. Results were similar whether the two abilities were modeled (Study 1) or calculated using proportions (Studies 1 and 2). These findings demonstrate numeric ability as a robust predictor of superior decision making across multiple tasks and outcomes. They also indicate that correlations of decision performance with the CRT are insufficient evidence to implicate overriding intuitions in the decision-making biases and outcomes we examined. Numeric ability appears to be the key mechanism instead.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinayev","given":"Aleksandr"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Ellen"}],"citation-key":"sinayevCognitiveReflectionVs2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Could this visibility prime new reviewers' attention (due to the human's proneness to availability bias), thus biasing the code review outcome? In this study, we investigate this topic by conducting a controlled experiment with 85 developers who perform a code review and a psychological experiment. With the psychological experiment, we find that ≈70% of participants are prone to availability bias. However, when it comes to the code review, our experiment results show that participants are primed only when the existing code review comment is about a type of bug that is not normally considered; when this comment is visible, participants are more likely to find another occurrence of this type of bug. Moreover, this priming effect does not influence reviewers' likelihood of detecting other types of bugs. Our findings suggest that the current code review practice is effective because existing review comments about bugs in code changes are not negative primers, rather positive reminders for bugs that would otherwise be overlooked during code review.

In Study 1, 258 college students estimated how much their own chances of experiencing 42 events differed from the chances of their classmates. Overall, they rated their own chances to be above average for positive events and below average for negative events, ps<.001. Cognitive and motivational considerations led to predictions that degree of desirability, perceived probability, personal experience, perceived controllability, and stereotype salience would influence the amount of optimistic bias evoked by different events. All predictions were supported, although the pattern of effects differed for positive and negative events. Study 2 tested the idea that people are unrealistically optimistic because they focus on factors that improve their own chances of achieving desirable outcomes and fail to realize that others may have just as many factors in their favor. Students listed the factors that they thought influenced their own chances of experiencing eight future events. When such lists were read by a second group of students, the amount of unrealistic optimism shown by this second group for the same eight events decreased significantly, although it was not eliminated. According to popular belief, people tend to think they are invulnerable. They expect others to be victims of misfortune, not themselves. Such ideas imply not merely a hopeful outlook on life, but an error in judgment that can be labeled unrealistic optimism. It is usually impossible to demonstrate that an individual's optimistic expectations about the future are unrealistic. An individual might be quite correct in asserting that his or her chances of experiencing a negative event are less than average. On a group basis, however, it is relatively easy to test for an optimistic bias.

It is described as measuring ‘cognitive reflection’ - a metacognitive trait capturing the degree to which people prefer to reflect on answers rather than giving intuitive responses. Herein, we ask how much of the CRT’s success can be explained by assuming it is a test of numerical (rather than general) intelligence. Our results show CRT is closely related to numerical ability and that its predictive power is limited to biases with a numerical basis. Although it may also capture some aspect of a rational cognition decision style, it is unrelated to a metacognitive, error-checking and inhibition measure. We conclude that the predictive power of the CRT can, largely, be explained via numerical ability without the need to posit a separate ‘cognitive reflection’ trait.","author":[{"family":"Welsh","given":"Matthew B"},{"family":"Burns","given":"Nicholas R"},{"family":"Delfabbro","given":"Paul H"}],"citation-key":"welshCognitiveReflectionTest2013","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"7","source":"Zotero","title":"The Cognitive Reflection Test: how much more than Numerical Ability?","type":"article-journal"},
