  abstract = {Social loafing is the tendency of individuals to withhold contributions to a task in a team setting. Team size and dispersion are two primary drivers of social loafing in technology-supported team settings. However, the mechanisms through which these drivers affect social loafing are not well understood. Consequently, the objective of this study is to identify the cognitive mechanisms that mediate the effect of team size and dispersion on social loafing in technology-supported teams. Drawing on the theory of moral disengagement, we posit that three primary cognitive mechanisms\textemdash diffusion of responsibility, attribution of blame, and dehumanization\textemdash will mediate the effect of team size and dispersion on social loafing. We conducted a laboratory study involving 140 students randomly assigned to 32 teams performing a brainstorming task using group systems software. The results show that diffusion of responsibility, attribution of blame, and dehumanization all mediate (partially) the effects of team size on social loafing. Meanwhile, only dehumanization mediates (fully) the effect of dispersion on social loafing.},

An analysis of vulnerability data disseminated by organizations such as NIST' s National Vulnerability (NVD) and SANS Institute shows that a majority of vulnerabilities can be traced back to a relatively small set of root causes mostly related to the repeated mistakes by the programmers. That is, programmers exhibit a pattern of erroneous coding practices or behavior which lead to vulnerable code. Cognitive Psychologists have long been studying these erroneous behavior patterns and have termed them as human cognition failures or simply, human errors. The primary goal of this paper is to propose a classification for the most frequently observed human errors committed by the programmers (the commitment of a human error can lead to injection of one or more security defects/bugs). Such a classification can be useful for software development organizations as they can train developers on the human errors so that developers can avoid committing the human errors themselves, thereby reducing the chances of vulnerability injection in their code.},

Best practices often ignore factors affecting teams' operational strategies. Division of labour is one example, whereby complying with best practices would require some teams to restructure and re-assign tasks\textemdash an effort typically viewed as unreasonable. Other influential factors include company culture, security knowledge, external pressure, and experiencing a security incident.},

  abstract = {Although theory suggests individuals are more willing to incur a personal cost to benefit ingroup members, compared to outgroup members, there is inconsistent evidence in support of this perspective. Applying meta-analytic techniques, we harness a relatively recent explosion of research on intergroup discrimination in cooperative decision making to address several fundamental unresolved issues. First, summarizing evidence across studies, we find a small to medium effect size indicating that people are more cooperative with ingroup, compared to outgroup, members (d = 0.32). Second, we forward and test predictions about the conditions that moderate ingroup favoritism from 2 influential perspectives: a social identity approach and a bounded generalized reciprocity perspective. Although we find evidence for a slight tendency for ingroup favoritism through categorization with no mutual interdependence between group members (e.g., dictator games; d = 0.19), situations that contain interdependence result in stronger ingroup favoritism (e.g., social dilemmas; d = 0.42). We also find that ingroup favoritism is stronger when there is common (vs. unilateral) knowledge of group membership, and stronger during simultaneous (vs. sequential) exchanges. Third, we find support for the hypothesis that intergroup discrimination in cooperation is the result of ingroup favoritism rather than outgroup derogation. Finally, we test for additional moderators of ingroup favoritism, such as the percentage of men in the sample, experimental versus natural groups, and the country of participants. We discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical perspectives on ingroup favoritism, address implications for the methodologies used to study this phenomenon, and suggest directions for future research.

  abstract = {Moral agency has dual aspects manifested in both the power to refrain from behaving inhumanely and the proactive power to behave humanely. Moral agency is embedded in a broader socio-cognitive self-theory encompassing affective self-regulatory mechanisms rooted in personal standards linked to self-sanctions. Moral functioning is thus governed by self-reactive selfhood rather than by dispassionate abstract reasoning. The self-regulatory mechanisms governing moral conduct do not come into play unless they are activated and there are many psychosocial mechanisms by which moral self-sanctions are selectively disengaged from inhumane conduct. The moral disengagement may centre on the cognitive restructuring of inhumane conduct into a benign or worthy one by moral justi cation, sanitising language and exonerative social comparison; disavowal of personal agency in the harm one causes by diffusion or displacement of responsibility; disregarding or minimising the injurious effects of one's actions; and attribution of blame to, and dehumanisation of, those who are victimised. Social cognitive theory adopts an interactionist perspective to morality in which moral actions are the products of the reciprocal interplay of personal and social in uences. Given the many mechanisms for disengaging moral control at both the individual and collective level, civilised life requires, in addition to humane personal standards, safeguards built into social systems that uphold compassionate behaviour and renounce cruelty.},

In many contexts, discrimination takes the form of ingroup bias, whereby members of one's own social categories are evaluated more positively or responded to more favorably than members of other social categories (outgroups). In much of the social psychological literature, discrimination is viewed as the behavioral component of prejudice. In light of this conflation of prejudice and discrimination, it is interesting that ingroup bias is often referred to as ingroup favoritism, whereas prejudice is most often defined as outgroup hostility. This chapter reviews theory and empirical research on the relationship between ingroup bias and outgroup hostility and argues that it is important to distinguish between these two loci of discrimination and to recognize that much intergroup discrimination takes the form of ingroup favoritism in the absence of outgroup antagonism.

  abstract = {Blindspots in APIs can cause software engineers to introduce vulnerabilities, but such blindspots are, unfortunately, common. We study the effect APIs with blindspots have on developers in two languages by replicating a 109-developer, 24-Java-API controlled experiment. Our replication applies to Python and involves 129 new developers and 22 new APIs. We find that using APIs with blindspots statistically significantly reduces the developers' ability to correctly reason about the APIs in both languages, but that the effect is more pronounced for Python. Interestingly, for Java, the effect increased with complexity of the code relying on the API, whereas for Python, the opposite was true. This suggests that Python developers are less likely to notice potential for vulnerabilities in complex code than in simple code, whereas Java developers are more likely to recognize the extra complexity and apply more care, but are more careless with simple code. Whether the developers considered API uses to be more difficult, less clear, and less familiar did not have an effect on their ability to correctly reason about them. Developers with better long-term memory recall were more likely to correctly reason about APIs with blindspots, but short-term memory, processing speed, episodic memory, and memory span had no effect. Surprisingly, professional experience and expertise did not improve the developers' ability to reason about APIs with blindspots across both languages, with long-term professionals with many years of experience making mistakes as often as relative novices. Finally, personality traits did not significantly affect the Python developers' ability to reason about APIs with blindspots, but less extraverted and more open developers were better at reasoning about Java APIs with blindspots. Overall, our findings suggest that blindspots in APIs are a serious problem across languages, and that experience and education alone do not overcome that problem, suggesting that tools are needed to help developers recognize blindspots in APIs as they write code that uses those APIs.},

However, the number of new vulnerabilities found in today's systems is still increasing. Furthermore, old and well-studied vulnerability types such as buffer overflows and SQL injections, are still repeatedly reported in vulnerability databases. Historically, the common response has been to blame the developers for their lack of security education. This paper discusses a new hypothesis to explain this problem by introducing a new security paradigm where software vulnerabilities are viewed as developers' blind spots in their decision making. We argue that such a flawed mental process is heuristic-based, where humans solve problems without considering all the information available, just like taking shortcuts. This paper's thesis is that security thinking tends to be left out by developers during their programming, as vulnerabilities usually exist in corner cases with unusual information flows. Leveraging this paradigm, this paper introduces a novel methodology for capturing and understanding security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, it discusses how this methodology can be applied to the design and implementation of the next generation of automated diagnosis tools.},

They, like the networks they operate, must also be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient. Defining the knowledge, skills, attributes and other characteristics is not as simple as defining a group of technical skills that people can be trained on; the complexity of the cyber domain makes this a unique challenge. There has been little research devoted to exactly what attributes individuals in the cyber domain need. What research does exist places an emphasis on technical and engineering skills while discounting the important social and organizational influences that dictate success or failure in everyday settings. This paper reviews the literature on cyber expertise and cyber workforce development to identify gaps and then argues for the important contribution of social fit in the highly-complex and heterogenous cyber workforce. We then identify six assumptions for the future of cybersecurity workforce development, including the requirement for systemic thinkers, team players, a love for continued learning, strong communication ability, a sense of civic duty, and a blend of technical and social skill. Finally, we make recommendations for social and cognitive metrics which may be indicative of future performance in cyber work roles to provide a roadmap for future scholars.},

  abstract = {Individual internet users are commonly considered the weakest links in the cybersecurity chain. One reason for this is that they tend to be overoptimistic regarding their own online safety. To gain a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in this assessment, the current study applies an extended version of the protection motivation theory. More specifically, this study includes perceived knowledge and internet trust to discover how these antecedents influence the threat and coping appraisal processes. Based on representative survey data collected from 967 respondents, we found that people who feel well-informed about online safety feel less vulnerable to cybercrime and are less inclined to take security measures. At the same time, feeling informed is associated with being more convinced of the severity of cybercrime. High levels of trust in the safety of the internet are linked to the feeling that one is less vulnerable to cybercrime and the perception that cybercrime is not a severe threat. Future interventions should remind internet users about their own perceived vulnerability and the risks that exist online while ensuring that internet users do not lose their trust in the internet and confidence in their own online knowledge.},

I draw on two important factors for an actor's trust in a partner: trust depends on the partner's competence and on the partner's interests (and benevolence). I propose that the conditions under which it is rational to trust and defer to experts depend on the competences of the layperson and the expert, and the degree of interest alignment. I present a model that demonstrates that it can be practically infeasible and even logically impossible to determine the expert's level of competence and the degree of interest alignment. Although it may sound pessimistic that one can rationally refrain from trusting experts, I will also explore some more optimistic conclusions.},

We find that explicitly prompting developers to write a specification has a small positive effect on the security of password storage approaches implemented. However, developers often fail to store passwords securely, despite claiming to be confident and knowledgeable in their approaches, and despite considering an appropriate range of threats. We find a need for developer-centered usable mechanisms for telling developers how to store passwords: lists of what they must do are not working.}

Past studies have supported this observation by revealing a multitude of errors and developer pitfalls in the cryptographic implementations of software products. However, the emphasis of these studies was on individual developers; there is an obvious gap in more thoroughly understanding cryptographic development practices of organizations. To address this gap, we conducted 21 in-depth interviews of highly experienced individuals representing organizations that include cryptography in their products. Our findings suggest a security mindset not seen in other research results, demonstrated by strong organizational security culture and the deep expertise of those performing cryptographic development. This mindset, in turn, guides the careful selection of cryptographic resources and informs formal, rigorous development and testing practices. The enhanced understanding of organizational practices encourages additional research initiatives to explore variations in those implementing cryptography, which can aid in transferring lessons learned from more security-mature organizations to the broader development community through educational opportunities, tools, and other mechanisms. The findings also support past studies that suggest that the usability of cryptographic resources may be deficient, and provide additional suggestions for making these resources more accessible and usable to developers of varying skill levels.},

As part of an on-going effort to develop a holistic, predictive cyber security risk assessment model, the characterization of human factors, which includes human behavior, is needed to understand how the actions of users, defenders, and attackers affect cyber security risk. The work group developing this new cyber security risk assessment model and framework has chosen to distinguish between trust and confidence by using ``trust'' only for human factors, and ``confidence'' for all non-human factors (e.g. hardware and software) in order to reduce confusion between the two concepts within our model. We have developed an initial framework for how to incorporate trust as a factor/parameter within a larger characterization of the human influences (users, defenders and attackers) on cyber security risk. Trust in the human factors is composed of two main categories: inherent characteristics, that which is a part of the individual, and situational characteristics, that which is outside of the individual. The use of trust as a human factor in holistic cyber security risk assessment will also rely on understanding how differing mental models and risk postures impact the level trust given to an individual and the biases affecting the ability to give said trust.},

Software engineers face high levels of uncertainty and risk during functional and security decision making. This preregistered study investigates behavioural measures of cognitive reflection, risk aversion, and optimism bias among professional freelance software developers and computer science students, to expose relationships between uncertainty-associated language and risk sensitivity. We employ content analysis with a mixed-effect model to understand how psychological dimensions influence risk sensitivity in secure software development. We show an interaction between cognitive reflection and optimism bias in the proportion of uncertainty-related language used. Overly optimistic outlooks combined with higher cognitive reflection drives up expressions of uncertainty, while pessimistic or realistic individuals reduce uncertainty as cognitive reflection increases. Software engineers who hold average or pessimistic views on the security of their code are more likely to speak more intuitively about security and risk. We discuss the potential for psychological interventions to promote more secure coding behaviours in software engineers. By increasing potential risk awareness, they may consider risk in software more carefully, which may lead to better security implementation in their code.},

  abstract = {When writing software code, developers typically prioritise functionality over security, either consciously or unconsciously through biases and heuristics. This is often attributed to tangible pressures such as client requirements, but little is understood about the psychological dimensions affecting security behaviours. There is an increasing demand for understanding how psychological skills affect secure software development and to understand how these skills themselves are developed during the learning process. This doctoral research explores this research space, with aims to identify important workplace-based skills for software developers; to identify and empirically investigate the soft skills behind these workplace skills in order to understand how soft skills can influence security behaviours; and, to identify ways to introduce and teach soft skills to computer science students to prepare the future generation of software developers. The motivations behind this research are presented alongside the work plan. Three distinct phases are introduced, along with planned analyses. Phase one is currently in the data collection stage, with the second phase in planning. Prior relevant work is highlighted, and the paper concludes with a presentation of preliminary results and the planned next steps.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

  abstract = {Information security has adapted to the modern collaborative organisational nature, and abandoned ``command-andcontrol'' approaches of the past. But when it comes to managing employee's information security behaviour, many organisations still use policies proscribing behaviour and sanctioning non-compliance. Whilst many organisations are aware that this ``comply or die'' approach does not work for modern enterprises where employees collaborate, share, and show initiative, they do not have an alternative approach to fostering secure behaviour. We present an interview analysis of 126 employees' reasons for not complying with organisational policies, identifying the perceived conflict of security with productive activities as the key driver for non-compliance and confirm the results using a survey of 1256 employees. We conclude that effective problem detection and security measure adaptation needs to be de-centralised - employees are the principal agents who must decide how to implement security in specific contexts. But this requires a higher level of security awareness and skills than most employees currently have. Any campaign aimed at security behaviour needs to transform employee's perception of their role in security, transforming them to security-aware principal agents.},

We found that people who reported engaging in heavy amounts of media multitasking reported being more impulsive and performed more poorly on measures of fluid intelligence than did those who did not frequently engage in media multitasking.

Focusing on bias antecedents, effects and mitigation techniques, we identified 65 articles (published between 1990 and 2016), which investigate 37 cognitive biases. Despite strong and increasing interest, the results reveal a scarcity of research on mitigation techniques and poor theoretical foundations in understanding and interpreting cognitive biases. Although bias-related research has generated many new insights in the software engineering community, specific bias mitigation techniques are still needed for software professionals to overcome the deleterious effects of cognitive biases on their work.},

This paper examines how the employees' role and type of competence may affect their estimation strategy and performance. An analysis of actual web-development project data and results from an experiment suggest that people with technical competence provided less realistic project effort estimates than those with less technical competence. This means that more knowledge about how to implement a requirement specification does not always lead to better estimation performance. We discuss, amongst others, two possible reasons for this observation: (1) Technical competence induces a bottom-up, construction-based estimation strategy, while lack of this competence induces a more ``outside'' view of the project, using a top-down estimation strategy. An ``outside'' view may encourage greater use of the history of previous projects and reduce the bias towards over-optimism. (2) Software professionals in technical roles perceive that they are evaluated as more skilled when providing low effort estimates. A consequence of our findings is that the choice of estimation strategy, estimation evaluation criteria and feedback are important aspects to consider when seeking to improve estimation accuracy.},

Accordingly, in this paper, we identify current research on psychological traits and individual differences among computer system users that explain vulnerabilities to cyber security attacks and crimes. Our review shows that computer system users possess different cognitive capabilities which determine their ability to counter information security threats.

Using 80 male undergraduates, this assumption was tested in a 2  2 design in which individuals or groups gave advice that led to success or failure. Group failure Ss assumed less responsibility than Ss in the other 3 conditions. Furthermore, individual failure Ss rated the outcomes as less bad and saw themselves as having less influence over the advisee.

The authors' results showed that, without explicit prompting, none of the students implemented secure password storage. When asked about this oversight, a common answer was that they would have implemented secure storage - if they were creating code for a company. To shed light on this possible confusion, we conducted a mixed-methods field study with developers. We hired freelance developers online and gave them a similar password storage task followed by a questionnaire to gain additional insights into their work. From our research, we offer two contributions. First of all, we reveal that, similar to the students, freelancers do not store passwords securely unless prompted, they have misconceptions about secure password storage, and they use outdated methods. Secondly, we discuss the methodological implications of using freelancers and students in developer studies.},

For end-users, many of these issues have been studied extensively, highlighting problems and informing design decisions for better policies and motivating research into alternatives. However, end-users are not the only ones who have usability problems with passwords! Developers who are tasked with writing the code by which passwords are stored must do so securely. Yet history has shown that this complex task often fails due to human error with catastrophic results. While an end-user who selects a bad password can have dire consequences, the consequences of a developer who forgets to hash and salt a password database can lead to far larger problems. In this paper we present a first qualitative usability study with 20 computer science students to discover how developers deal with password storage and to inform research into aiding developers in the creation of secure password systems.},

Perfecting and adding such tools to the Android development environment is an essential step in getting both security and privacy for the next generation of apps.},

A series of experiments addressed whether there are systematic differences in information processing styles between chronically heavy and light media multitaskers. A trait media multitasking index was developed to identify groups of heavy and light media multitaskers. These two groups were then compared along established cognitive control dimensions. Results showed that heavy media multitaskers are more susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli and from irrelevant representations in memory. This led to the surprising result that heavy media multitaskers performed worse on a test of task-switching ability, likely due to reduced ability to filter out interference from the irrelevant task set. These results demonstrate that media multitasking, a rapidly growing societal trend, is associated with a distinct approach to fundamental information processing.},

We run 25 semi-structured interviews with developers of both large and small-medium enterprises located in nine countries. All interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed according to applied thematic analysis. They highlight the trade-offs that developers are facing and that security researchers must understand to provide effective support to mitigate vulnerabilities (for example bundling security fixes with functional changes might hinder adoption due to lack of resources to fix functional breaking changes). We further distill our observations to actionable implications on what algorithms and automated tools should achieve to effectively support (semi-)automatic dependency management.},

We report from a one-year study of a penetration test run at a major software vendor, and describe how a software development team managed to incorporate the test findings.

This question has been asked by economists, psychologists, and other researchers in the social sciences \textendash{} which has generated a diversity of research accounts and results. For example, a number of studies have found strong instances of a risky shift in choices for others, while other studies have found no such effect or have found that choices for others instead generate a cautious shift. In a meta-analysis of 128 effects from 71 published and unpublished papers (totaling 14,443 observations), we found a significant though small effect size (d\,=\,0.105) in favor of a risky shift when people choose for others. Moreover, we found considerable variance between studies (Q\,=\,1106.25), suggesting that the net effect is susceptible to moderating factors or study characteristics, which we identify and discuss as well (viz. choice recipient, decision frame, decision reciprocity, theoretical perspective, study design). Thus, we document not only whether decisions for others are riskier, but when (and when such decisions are less risky). We further discuss what is distinctly unique about decision making for others \textendash{} how such choices are not just different in degree from personal choices but different in kind.},

Without knowledge of social science, developers, managers and researchers may misunderstand the social aspects of their projects, leading to ineffective decisions and actions. Yet, social science theories are rarely applied to Software Engineering (SE). Furthermore, understanding a single software project frequently necessitates combining multiple theories---often from several disciplines. This paper therefore aims to illustrate how certain social theories work together in a complementary manner to understand various dynamics of a software development project. To illustrate this, seven theories to understand key dynamics --- Actor Network Theory, Theory of Boundary Objects, Complexity Theory, Theory of Cognitive Biases, Effectuation Theory, Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Theory and Transactive Memory Theory --- are used to explain a longitudinal study of a software development project. This study illustrates the need for integrating more social science into SE research and curriculum.},

  abstract = {Despite the availability of various methods and tools to facilitate secure coding, developers continue to write code that contains common vulnerabilities. It is important to understand why technological advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests ``adaptive security interventions'' as a solution that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent studies show that secure coding is about not only technical requirements but also developers' behaviour. Objective: To understand the influence of socio-technical contexts on how developers attend to and engage with security in code, software engineering researchers collaborated with social psychologists on a psychologically-informed study. Method: In a preregistered, between-group, controlled experiment, 124 developers from multiple freelance communities, were primed toward one of three identities, following which they completed code review tasks with open-ended responses. Qualitative analysis of the rich data focused on the attitudes and reasoning that shaped their identification of security issues within code. Results: Overall, attention to code security was intermittent and heterogeneous in focus. Although social identity priming did not significantly change the code review, qualitative analysis revealed that developers varied in how they noticed issues in code, how they addressed them, and how they justified their choices. Conclusion: We found that many developers do think about security \textendash{} but differently from one another. Hence, effective interventions to promote secure coding must be appropriate to the individual development context. Data is uploaded at: https://osf.io/3jvrk},

Although security is an important quality requirement for the social sustainability of software, existing studies have shown differences in the way security issues are handled by developers working in OFSD compared to those working in organisational environments. This paper investigates the security culture of OFSD developers, and identifies significant themes in how security is conceived, practiced, and compensated. Based on in-depth interviews with 20 freelance (FL) developers, we report that (a) security thinking is evident in descriptions of their work, (b) security thinking manifests in different ways within OFSD practice, and (c) the dynamics of the freelance development ecosystem influence financial investment in secure development. Our findings help to understand the reasons why insecure software development is evident in freelance development, and they contribute toward developing security interventions that are tailored to the needs of freelance software developers.},

We argue that simply blaming users will not lead to more effective security systems. Security designers must identify the causes of undesirable user behaviour, and address these to design effective security systems. We present examples of how undesirable user behaviour with passwords can be caused by failure to recognise the characteristics of human memory, unattainable or conflicting task demands, and lack of support, training and motivation. We conclude that existing human/computer interaction knowledge and techniques can be used to prevent or address these problems, and outline a vision of a holistic design approach for usable and effective security.},

We investigate the decision-making conversations of 7 teams of senior managers from the same organisation, as they complete the Decisions\&Disruptions (D-D) cyber security exercise. We use Grounded Theory to situate our analysis of their decision-making and help us explore how these complex socio-cognitive interactions occur. We have developed a goal-model (using iStar 2.0) of the teams' dialogue which illustrates what cyber security goals teams identify and how they operationalise their decisions to reach these goals. We complement this with our model of cyber security reasoning which describes how these teams make their decisions, showing how each team members' experience, intuition and understanding affects the team's overall shared reasoning and decision-making. Our findings show how managers with little cyber security expertise are able to use logic and traditional risk management thinking to make cyber security decisions. Despite their lack of cyber security specific training they demonstrate reasoning which closely resembles the decision-making approaches espoused in cyber security specific standards (e.g., NIST/ISO). Our work demonstrates how organisations and practitioners can enrich goal modelling to capture not only what security goals an organisation has (and how they can operationalise them) but also how and why these goals have been identified. Ultimately, non-cyber security experts can develop their cyber security model based on their current context (and update it when new requirements appear or new incidents happen), whilst capturing their reasoning at every stage.},

Previous research suggests that interpersonal perceptions of trustworthiness are closely related to this behaviour. The present research suggests that the more proximal determinant of trusting behaviour is the expectation that the other will reciprocate. Based on the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) model, reciprocity expectations may be created by interpersonal perceptions of trustworthiness or a shared group membership. To investigate this, group membership and individual identifiability were experimentally manipulated (N = 139): When individuals were not identifiable, trusting behaviour was based on expectations of reciprocity inferred from group membership, not on perceived trustworthiness. In contrast, personal identifiability fostered perceptions of trustworthiness for both in- and out-group members. In this case interpersonal trustworthiness enhanced expectations of reciprocity, which in turn increased trusting behaviour. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In 2 experiments, they examined how Ss with varying expertise performed functional testing of software. There was substantial evidence of the use of a positive test strategy: Ss tended to test only those functions and aspects of the software that were specifically described in the specifications as what the software was supposed to do. This effect was only partially mitigated by increasing expertise among testers and by more complete program specifications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We report the results of three large-scale national studies in Norway that included the cognitive reflection test (CRT) and a choice experiment on willingness to share personal data. With a binary logistic regression method, we analyzed the relationship between the CRT, willingness to share data and demographical variables with susceptibility to phishes as the outcome variable. Our main finding is that the willingness to share personal data and an intuitive thinking style significantly predict the probability of falling for phish.

Objective To make a critical examination of technical debt and consolidate understanding of the nature of technical debt and its implications for software development. Method An exploratory case study technique that involves multivocal literature review, supplemented by interviews with software practitioners and academics to establish the boundaries of the technical debt phenomenon. Result A key outcome of this research is the creation of a theoretical framework that provides a holistic view of technical debt comprising a set of technical debts dimensions, attributes, precedents and outcomes, as well as the phenomenon itself and a taxonomy that describes and encompasses different forms of the technical debt phenomenon. Conclusion The proposed framework provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes.

Favouritism towards own group is hypothesized to arise from intergroup comparisons to enhance self-esteem as well as instrumental rivalry for group and self-interest. Sixty-two fourteen to fifteen years' old school-boys and girls were randomly assigned to a high or low reward condition in which they distributed monetary rewards, via choice-matrices, to the ingroup and a relevant comparison outgroup, and the ingroup and an irrelevant comparison outgroup. Monetary self-interest was explicitly and directly linked to ingroup's absolute profit. Ss sacrificed group and personal gain to achieve intergroup differences in monetary outcomes favouring the ingroup; and were less fair and more discriminatory towards the relevant than irrelevant outgroup. especially with High Rewards.},

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.

The experiment is designed so that use of confirming evidence alone will almost certainly lead to erroneous conclusions because (i) the correct concept is entailed by many more obvious ones, and (ii) the universe of possible instances (numbers) is infinite., Six out of 29 subjects reached the correct conclusion without previous incorrect ones, 13 reached one incorrect conclusion, nine reached two or more incorrect conclusions, and one reached no conclusion. The results showed that those subjects, who reached two or more incorrect conclusions, were unable, or unwilling to test their hypotheses.

Overall, they rated their own chances to be above average for positive events and below average for negative events, ps{$<$}.001. Cognitive and motivational considerations led to predictions that degree of desirability, perceived probability, personal experience, perceived controllability, and stereotype salience would influence the amount of optimistic bias evoked by different events. All predictions were supported, although the pattern of effects differed for positive and negative events. Study 2 tested the idea that people are unrealistically optimistic because they focus on factors that improve their own chances of achieving desirable outcomes and fail to realize that others may have just as many factors in their favor. Students listed the factors that they thought influenced their own chances of experiencing eight future events. When such lists were read by a second group of students, the amount of unrealistic optimism shown by this second group for the same eight events decreased significantly, although it was not eliminated. According to popular belief, people tend to think they are invulnerable. They expect others to be victims of misfortune, not themselves. Such ideas imply not merely a hopeful outlook on life, but an error in judgment that can be labeled unrealistic optimism. It is usually impossible to demonstrate that an individual's optimistic expectations about the future are unrealistic. An individual might be quite correct in asserting that his or her chances of experiencing a negative event are less than average. On a group basis, however, it is relatively easy to test for an optimistic bias. If all people claim their changes of experiencing a negative event are less than}

This paper describes a measuring approach to assess twelve aspects of this security maturity; its use to assess the impact of a lightweight package of workshops designed to increase security maturity; and a novel approach within that package to support developers in resource negotiation. Based on trials in eight organizations, involving over 80 developers, this paper demonstrates that (1) development teams can notably improve their security maturity even in the absence of security specialists; and (2) suitably guided, developers can find effective ways to promote security to product management. Empowering developers to make their own decisions and promote security in this way offers a powerful grassroots approach to improving the security of software worldwide.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes organizational functioning from the perspective of social cognitive theory, which explains psychosocial functioning in terms of triadic reciprocal causation. In this causal structure, behavior, cognitive, and other personal factors and environmental events operate as interacting determinants that influence each other bidirectionally. The application of the theory is illustrated in a series of experiments of complex managerial decision making, using a simulated organization. The interactional causal structure is tested in conjunction with experimentally varied organizational properties and belief systems that can enhance or undermine the operation of the self-regulatory determinants. Induced beliefs about the controllability of organizations and the conception of managerial ability strongly affect both managers' self-regulatory processes and their organizational attainments. Organizational complexity and assigned performance standards also serve as contributing influences. Path analyses reveal that perceived managerial self-efficacy influences managers' organizational attainments both directly and through its effects on their goal setting and analytic thinking. Personal goals, in turn, enhance organizational attainments directly and via the mediation of analytic strategies. As managers begin to form a self-schema of their efficacy through further experience, the performance system is regulated more strongly and intricately through their self-conceptions of managerial efficacy. Although the relative strength of the constituent influences changes with increasing experience, these influences operate together as a triadic reciprocal control system.},

We conducted a semi-structured interview study on 15 professional software developers to understand their perceptions and behaviors related to software security. Our results reveal a disconnect between developers' conceptual understanding of security and their attitudes regarding their personal responsibility and practices for software security.},

Software engineers face high levels of uncertainty and risk during functional and security decision making. This preregistered study investigates behavioural measures of cognitive reflection, risk aversion, and optimism bias among professional freelance software developers and computer science students, to expose relationships between uncertainty-associated language and risk sensitivity. We employ content analysis with a mixed-effect model to understand how psychological dimensions influence risk sensitivity in secure software development. We show an interaction between cognitive reflection and optimism bias in the proportion of uncertainty-related language used. Overly optimistic outlooks combined with higher cognitive reflection drives up expressions of uncertainty, while pessimistic or realistic individuals reduce uncertainty as cognitive reflection increases. Software engineers who hold average or pessimistic views on the security of their code are more likely to speak more intuitively about security and risk. We discuss the potential of our findings in relation to understanding how to leverage language used by engineers as markers of risk aversion. Encouraging increased discourse could be used as a catalyst for increased cognitive reflection and grounding optimistic behaviours, leading to more careful decisions.},
